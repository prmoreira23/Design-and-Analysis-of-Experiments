{Statistical Inference}
{Introduction}
Definitions such as point estimators and statistical intervals belong to a branch of statistical theory known as \textit{descriptive statistics}, that is, methods that are focused on accurately describing characteristics such as location or uncertainty about a given population parameter;
\vone
While these concepts are certainly important, in many cases description is not enough -- one may need decision-making tools to deal with information from random samples, tools that allow a researcher to perform \textit{inference} with a quantifiable degree of certainty.

{Statistical Hypotheses}
{Definitions}
\textit{Statistical hypotheses} are defined as objective statements about parameters of one ore more populations;
\vone
\textbf{Attention}: the statements in statistical hypotheses are about parameters of the \textit{population} or \textit{model}, \textbf{not the \textit{sample}}.
\vone
On frequentist approaches, the formal test of hypotheses involves the contrast between \textit{null} and \textit{alternative} hypotheses.

\begin{ftst}
{Statistical Hypotheses}
{Definitions}
Determination of the reference value for the null hypothesis $H_0$:

\bitems Previous knowledge about the process (investigation of changes);
	\item Value obtained from theory or models (model validation);
	\item Project requirements (investigation of system compliance);
\eitem

Hypothesis testing involves:

\bitems Obtaining the sample;
	\item Calculation of test statistics;

\begin{ftst}
{Statistical Hypotheses}
{Example}
Suppose you are a large-scale customer of green peas\footnote[1]{\tiny We could use any other item on your usual grocery list, but why not pay a little tribute to Gregor Mendel?}, and that you want to determine if the $500$g packages from a given food supplier really contain their nominal weight (at least on average).
\vhalf
In this case the null hypothesis could be defined as:
\textit{the average net weight of a package is $500$g}, and the alternative of interest could be expressed as the complementary inequality.
\beqs\begin{cases}
H_0: \mu = 500g \\
H_1: \mu \neq 500g 
\end{cases}\eqs
\vone
Suppose still that $n=10$ randomly selected packs are obtained from this supplier, and their contents are weighted using a calibrated scale;

\begin{ftst}
{Statistical Hypotheses}
{Example}
Since the sample mean $\bar{x}$ is a good estimator of the real mean $\mu$, we can assume:

\bitems If $\bar{x} \cong 500$g - corroboration of $H_0$;
\item If $\bar{x} \ll 500$g or $\bar{x} \gg 500$g - refutation of $H_0$;
\eitem
\vone
Suggests the use of $\bar{x}$ as basis for a statistical test.

\begin{ftst}
{Inferential Errors}
{Type I error}
\begin{colorblock}{}{bg=green!30,fg=black}
\textbf{Type I error} (false positive): rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true.
\end{colorblock}
\vone
The probability of occurrence of a false positive in any hypothesis testing procedure is generally known as the \textit{significance level} of the test, represented by Greek letter $\alpha$:
\beqs \alpha = P\left(\mbox{type I error}\right) = P\left(\mbox{reject }H_0|H_0\mbox{ is true}\right)\eqs
\vone
Another frequently used term is the \textit{confidence level} of the test, given by $(1-\alpha)$.
\end{ftst}

%=====

\begin{ftst}
{Inferential Errors}
{Type I error}
For a given sample, the selected value of $\alpha$ defines the critical threshold for the rejection of $H_0$.
\vone
If $H_0$ is true (i.e., if $\mu=500$g), the distribution of values of $\bar{x}$ is aproximately normal (remember the CLT), with average $500$ and variance given by $s^2/n$;
\vone
For a Type-I error probability $\alpha=0.05$, the critical values of the distribution of $\bar{x}$ are the ones for which the probability content within the acceptance region is $1-\alpha = 0.95$.

\begin{ftst}
{Inferential Errors}
{Type II error}
\begin{colorblock}{}{bg=green!30,fg=black}
\textbf{Type II error} (false negative): failure to reject the null hypothesis when it is false.
\end{colorblock}
\vone
The probability of occurrence of a false negative in any hypothesis testing procedure is generally represented by the Greek letter $\beta$:

\beqs 
\beta = P\left(\mbox{type II error}\right) = P\left(\mbox{not reject }H_0|H_0\mbox{ is false}\right)
\eqs

The quantity ($1-\beta$) is known as \textit{power} of the test, and quantifies its sensitivity to effects that violate the null hypothesis.
\end{ftst}

{Inferential Errors}
{Type II error}
\begin{columns}[T]
	\column{0.55\textwidth}
		Unlike the Type-I error, the definition of the Type-II error rate requires further specification of the value of the parameter being investigated under the alternative hypothesis;
		\vone
		The probability of failing to reject a false $H_0$ is strongly dependent on the magnitude of the difference between the value under $H_0$ and the real value of the parameter.

%=====

\begin{ftst}
{Inferential Errors}
{Type II error}
The power of a test is governed by several factors:

\bitems Controllable: significance level, sample size;
	\item Uncontrollable: real value of the parameter;
\eitem

If $H_0$ is false, the smaller the magnitude of the difference between the real value of the parameter and the one under the null hypothesis, the greater the probability of a type II error - \textbf{\textit{but the practical importance of the effect gets smaller}}.
\end{ftst}

%=====

\begin{ftst}
{Inferential Errors}
{Considerations}
\textbf{Type I error} ($\alpha$) depends only on the distribution of the null hypothesis - easier to control;
\vone
\textbf{Type II error} ($\beta$) depends on the real value of the parameter - more difficult to specify and control;
\vone
These characteristics lead to the following classification of the conclusions obtained from the test of hypotheses:
\begin{block}{}
\bitems Rejection of $H_0$ - \textit{strong} conclusion; 
\spitem Failure to reject $H_0$ - \textit{weak} conclusion (but we can strengthen it);
\eitem
\end{block}
\vone
It is important to remember that failing to reject $H_0$ does not mean that there is evidence in favor of $H_0$ - it only suggests that it is a better model than the alternative.

\begin{ftst}
{Hypothesis Testing}
{Mean of a normal distribution, variance known}
Back to the green peas example, we want to determine if there is any significant deviation on the mean weight of the packages. Assume for now that the variance of the process is known. The test hypotheses are defined as:

\beqs\begin{cases}
H_0: \mu = 500g\\
H_1: \mu \neq 500g
\end{cases}\eqs
\vone
Let the desired significance level be $\alpha = 0.05$;
\vone
Given these characteristics, we expect that the sampling distribution of $\bar{X}$ is normal, with variance $Var(\bar{X})=\sigma^2/n$ and, if $H_0$ is true -- mean $\mu_{\bar{X}}=\mu_0=500$;
\begin{tikzpicture}[remember picture,overlay]
\node[anchor=north east,yshift=12pt,xshift=-5pt] at (current page.north east) {\includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{../figs/peas.png}};

%=====

\begin{ftst}
{Hypothesis Testing}
{Mean of a normal distribution, variance known}
Based on these characteristics, the variable
\beqs Z_0 = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu_0}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}\eqs
\vhalf
\noindent will be distributed according to the standard normal, $\mathcal{N}\left(0,1\right)$, but only \textbf{if $H_0$ is true}.
\vone
This result implies a probability of $\left(1-\alpha\right)$ that $Z_0$ will fall within the range $(\pm z_{\alpha/2})$\footnote[2]{\tiny $z_{\alpha/2}$ is the superior $100(1-\alpha/2)\%$ percentile of the standard normal distribution;} if $H_0$ is true, which provides a selection criterion between $H_0$ and $H_1$:

\bitems If $|z_0|>z_{\alpha/2}$, we reject $H_0$ at the confidence level $1-\alpha$;
	\item Otherwise, there is not enough evidence to reject $H_0$;
\eitem

\begin{ftst}
{Hypothesis Testing}
{Mean of a normal distribution, variance known}
Assume that we got $\bar{x} = 496.48 g$ from our $n=10$ observations, and that $\sigma = 10g$. In this case,

\beqs 
z_0 = \frac{496.48 - 500}{10/\sqrt{10}} = -1.113
\eqs
\vhalf
The critical values of the standard normal distribution are $\pm z_{\alpha/2} = \pm z_{0.025} = \pm 1.96$;
\vone
Since $|z_0|<z_{0.025}$, we can conclude that there is not enough evidence to reject $H_0$ at the $95\%$ confidence level.

{Mean of a normal distribution, variance unknown}
Suppose now a more realistic situation in which the real variance is unknown. Besides, assume that we are interested in detecting only negative deviations from the nominal contents of the package.
\vone
The test hypotheses can be defined as:
\beqs\begin{cases}
H_0: \mu = 500g\\
H_1: \mu < 500g 
\end{cases}\eqs
\vhalf
In this second scenario we want to be more conservative, so we pick a significance level of $\alpha = 0.01$;

It can be shown that, if \textbf{$H_0$ is true}, then

{Hypothesis Testing}
{p-values, significance and effect sizes}
To ``tell the whole story'' of the experiment, it is necessary to use \textbf{effect size estimators} alongside the tests of statistical significance; 
\vone
While there are whole books on the subject \footnote[3]{\tiny See, for instance, Paul D. Ellis' \textit{The Essential Guide to Effect Sizes}, Cambridge University Press, 2010.}, the main idea is quite simple - to quantify the magnitude of the observed deviation from the null hypothesis.
\vone
Examples of effect size estimators include the simple point estimator for the difference $\bar{x} - \mu_0$, or the dimensionless \textit{d} estimator:

\beqs
d = \frac{\bar{x}-\mu_0}{s}
\eqs

\noindent which quantifies the difference in terms of sample standard deviations.

{Some considerations}
The probability of Type-II error can be easily evaluated \textit{a posteriori}, but its definition \textit{a priori} requires some care;
\vone
The power of a test is essentially a function of 4 elements:
\bitems Actual size of the difference;
	\item Variability of the observations;
	\item Significance level;
	\item Sample size.
\eitem
\vone
The experimenter generally have little control over the first two.
\end{ftst}

%=====

\begin{ftst}{Sample size and Type-II error}
{Some considerations}
A strategy for estimating an effective lower bound for the power of a test includes a definition of an \textit{minimally interesting effect} $\delta^*$. 
\vone
This value must be derived from technical and scientific knowledge about the phenomenon or system under experimentation. 
\vhalf
\begin{block}{}
\centering It is essential to have a good understanding of the field in which the experiment will be conducted.
\end{block}
\vhalf
Once $\delta^*$ is defined, the experimenter can obtain an estimate of the variability of observations (e.g., by a pilot study), which can then be used to obtain an approximate power value for the experiment;
\end{ftst}

%=====

\begin{ftst}
{Sample size and Type-II error}
{Some considerations}
Having obtained this estimation of the Type-II error probability, one can run his/her experiment with a better understanding of its ability to detect effects of interest.
\vone
The test will have lower power for differences smaller than $\delta^*$, but these differences are below the minimally interesting effect; any effect greater than $\delta^*$ will result in a higher power for the test;
\vone
This technique can also be used as a way to compute the maximum necessary sample size for the experiment.

{Sample size and Type-II error}
{Example}
Suppose that on the green peas example one is really interested in detecting deviations from the nominal value greater than $1\%$, i.e., $\delta^* = 0.01*500 = 5g$. The researcher defines that, for this minimally interesting effect, a test power of $0.85$ is desired. The test will again be performed with $\alpha = 0.01$.
\vone
The same sample of $n=10$ packs is used. The estimated standard deviation for this sample is $s=6.97g$. From this data, we can compute the power of this test as:
\begin{columns}
\column[T]{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{rcode}
> s<-sd(sample)
> power.t.test(n=10, 
+        delta=5,

+        sig.level=0.01, 
+        type = "one.sample",

We need at least 25 observations to detect a $-5g\ (1\%)$ or larger deviation on the mean weight of the green peas packages with a power level of $0.85$.

{Model validation}
{The normality assumption}
The assumption of normality, required for the \textbf{z} and \textbf{t} tests, needs to be validated.
	\begin{colorblock}{}{bg=green!30,fg=black}
	``\textit{The Assumption of Normality (note the upper case) that underlies parametric stats does not assert that the observations within a given sample are normally distributed, nor does it assert that the values within the population (from which the sample was taken) are normal. This core element of the Assumption of Normality asserts that \textbf{the distribution of sample means (across independent samples) is normal.}}''\\

Analytical tests of normality (choose \textbf{one});
\bitems Shapiro-Wilk;
	\item Anderson-Darling;
	\item Lilliefors / Kolmogorov-Smirnov;
\eitem
\vone
These procedures use different aspects of the sample distribution to test the following hypotheses:
\beqs\begin{cases}
	H_0: \mbox{population is normal}\\
	H_1: \mbox{population is not normal}
\end{cases}\eqs
\vhalf
In this case, rejection of the null hypothesis suggests evidence that the sample came from a non-normal population. Generally we use a strict threshold (e.g., $\alpha = 0.01$ or $0.001$) for these tests, and consider their results together with a graphical analysis.

\begin{ftstf}
{Model validation}
{The normality assumption}
Even thought the Lilliefors / Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is possibly the most widely used for normality testing, the Shapiro-Wilk test is recommended as a better alternative in Michael Crawley's \textit{The R Book}, and will be used throughout this course.

{The independence assumption}
Possibly the strongest assumption of the statistical model used for the t-test is that of independence, that is, of the absence of unmodeled biases contaminating the data.
\vhalf
While I know of no procedure to test independence in the general case, serial autocorrelations in the residual data (which can emerge, for instance, as a consequence of heating effects or equipment degradation) can be tested by a procedure known as the Durbin-Watson test:
\begin{rcode}
> library(lmtest)
> dwtest(sample~1)

Durbin-Watson test
data:  sample ~ 1
DW = 2.1117, p-value = 0.573
alternative hypothesis: true autocorrelation is greater than 0
\end{rcode}
\begin{tikzpicture}[remember picture,overlay]
\node[anchor=north east,yshift=12pt,xshift=-5pt] at (current page.north east) {\includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{../figs/peas.png}};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{ftstf}

%=====

\begin{ftstf}
{Model validation}
{The independence assumption}
The Durbin-Watson test depends on the ordering of the data, so observations should be ordered (either in the data file or by manipulating the data vector) according to covariates that are suspected to introduce dependencies, e.g., order of collection, placement criteria, etc.
\vone
Violations of the independence assumption tend to be the hardest to weed out, so extra care is recommended in the design of the experiment in order to prevent, control, or at least document all variables that could introduce dependencies in the data.

{Going over the process}
After examining the green peas example, it is interesting to go back and follow the recommended sequence for this kind of experiment:

\bitems Formulate question of interest;
	\spitem Define minimally interesting effect;
	\spitem Define desired confidence and power;
	\spitem Calculate required sample size;
	\spitem Collect data;
	\spitem Perform statistical analysis;
	\spitem Draw conclusions and recommendations.
